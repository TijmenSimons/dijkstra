Just some attempt at recreating this algorithm in python, for fun.

## The `Nodes` folder

I've included some files named opX which just have different structures of nodes to test the `main.py` script on.
I've also provided some drawings from MS Paint to visualize the node structures.

## More explanation (aka a list of facts cuz im lazy i think)

- In the result table when printed out; if you see "x > y" it means that `y` was discovered later than `x` and `y` has takes it's place because `y` is cooler :D
- In the result table when printed out; when a node is printed with `✗` behind it's name, but when the line is colored green it and has a `✓` it is checked.
- When the script prints out "Stopped." it means something has gone wrong, as curious as I am, please make a PR with the test that managed to do so, I want to try and see if I can fix it.

### Other somethings

You can steal this repo or whatever lol.
Would not know why you would because it is probably slow as heck, but you do you.
